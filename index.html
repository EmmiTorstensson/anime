          Winchester has its own unique admissions process. We look for boys
          with enquiring minds and natural intelligence. Our founderâ€™s ethos was
          to educate such boys, whatever their background, hence our generous
          bursary provision. Experienced staff assist in every stage of the
          process, from initial inquiry through to choosing a house, to sitting
          the entrance exams.

            We spend time getting to know each prospective family during the
            admissions process. It is a unique system, focused on potential, not
            merely prior attainment. It is based substantially on interview and
            ensures that by the time a boy starts, he will often have had a
            number of years to get to know us.

            Each year we welcome a limited number of boys in to the Sixth Form,
            a choice which is becoming increasingly popular. Boys join to study
            our Pre-U curriculum and quickly take advantage of extra-curricular
            activities.
